## Definitions

This section describes the C2 language a bit more formally. If you really dont
want to miss a feature or just want to know what exactly is allowed, look here.

Each page will describe some part of the syntax, this is done in the following way:
```text
[..] - required parts
<..> - optional parts
name - keyword 'name'
```

### Example

```c
<public> type [Name] [type specification] ;
```

This means:

- the keyword _public_ is optional
- followed by keyword _type_
- followed by a required name (starting with a Capital letter)
- followed by a required type specification
- followed by a semi-colon
