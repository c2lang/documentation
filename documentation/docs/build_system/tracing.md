## Tracing

The c2c compiler support adding call tracing code natively with minimal
overhead.

To enable tracing for a target run:
```sh
$ c2c <target> --trace-calls -o target_trace
```

This will produce an *instrumented* version in *output/target_trace/*
The tracing can be configured and enabled at runtime by setting the *C2_TRACE*
environment variable:

```sh
C2_TRACE="min=10;min2=1;mode=3;name=*;fd=2" output/target_trace/target_trace 2> log
```

Options for C2_TRACE are separated by semi-colons:

* *min* - the minimal number of total calls to a function (otherwise not printed)
* *min2* - the minimal number of calls from a caller to a function (otherwise not printed)
* *mode* - 1 (print only callees), 2 (print only callers), 3 (print callers and callees)
* *indent* - indentation of callers during printing
* *fd* - the file-descriptor where output is printed on
* *name* - name of functions to be traced (eg my_mod.*)
* *filename* - the filenames of caller locations
* *caller* - the symbol names of callers (eg my_mod.*)

### Example

Tracing all calls to *malloc*, *calloc* and *free*, would be done as follows:

```sh
C2_STRACE="min2=500;mode=3;name=stdlib.malloc,stdlib.calloc,stdlib.free;fd=2" ./output/target_trace/target_trace
```

The output looks something like below and is sorted already.
