## comments

C2 allows comments in the same way as C. Thus 2 forms are available:

```c
// a one line comment
/* A
   multi-line
   comment
*/
```

## semi-colons

Every statement in C2 is followed by a semi-colon, __except__ when it ends with
a __right-hand brace__: } !!
Trailing attributes never change the rule above.

That means you will never see `};`.  Makes it easier on the eyes ;)
